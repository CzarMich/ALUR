Summary
Configuration Management:

Centralized the configuration using config_files.yml.
Ensured that file paths, including temporary folders and database paths, are managed through the configuration file.
Environment Variables:

Loaded environment variables from a .env file, making it easier to manage and change settings without modifying the script.
Folder and File Management:

Ensured that the temporary folder is created if it doesn't exist.
Added checks and logging to verify that paths are correctly set and used.
Database Management:

Dynamically created and updated SQLite tables based on JSON data.
Managed insertion of records into these tables, ensuring flexibility with data fields.
AQL Query Execution:

Read and executed AQL queries from XML files.
Encapsulated the logic for making authenticated API requests to execute the queries.
Tips for Further Improvements
Error Handling:

Enhance error handling by using try-except blocks to catch and log exceptions at critical points (e.g., file I/O, database operations, network requests).
Logging:

Replace print statements with a logging framework such as Python's logging module to provide more control over log levels and output destinations.
Unit Testing:

Implement unit tests to ensure each function works correctly. This is especially important for functions handling file operations and database interactions.
Modularization:

Further modularize the code by separating different concerns into distinct modules or classes. For example, you could have separate modules for configuration management, database operations, and API interactions.
Documentation:

Document the code and configuration files thoroughly to help future developers understand the functionality and usage.
Security:

Ensure sensitive data such as API credentials are stored securely and consider using environment variable management tools for better security practices.

Improved Logging:

import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Example usage of logging
logging.info(f"Temporary folder created at: {TEMP_FOLDER}")

# Replace all print statements with appropriate logging methods
