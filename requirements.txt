 Splitting Responsibilities
Currently, utils.py still does a variety of things:

Paths management (get_path-style functions)
State file management (get_last_run_time, set_last_run_time)
Session creation with requests_cache
(Optional) environment loading
That’s acceptable if the file isn’t too big. As the project grows, you might consider splitting out specialized areas to keep each utility file focused. For example:

path_utils.py for path management
db_utils.py for state file or SQLite interactions
session_utils.py for session management
